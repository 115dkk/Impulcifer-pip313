# Impulcifer

#### TODO:
- Fix: Headphone compensation FIR filter gain is too low
- Test signal parameters
- SNR to decay plot
- Waterfall plot
- Impulse response length adjustment
- Tracking filter for sweep recording
- Test signal end without fade-out
- Compacting filter for reducing pre-ringing in impulse responses
- Room correction
